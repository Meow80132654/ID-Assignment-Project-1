# ID-Assignment-Project-1
Basically this website is to sell handmade jewelry my mom makes. Its so people can see the and buy the stuff she makes.


The end goal in mind is to make a website similar to a merchandise store like those of youtubers or people who want to sell their homemade things.

The intention is to easily showcase what my mom has made so people will buy it.

As a user I would want to easily see what is in stock according to category as well as its details and price.

Features include a homepage, an about page, a page for each type of product and finally a page so people can make custom orders.

Features I havent implemented are the back end payment system, database of whats in stock as well as a delivery system.

technologies used include live server
